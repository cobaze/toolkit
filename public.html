						<p>Policies that make publicly-owned, underused or vacant land available for affordable housing could create new development opportunities in areas with high land costs. Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and Miami-Dade County School Board are frequently the largest landowners in various neighborhoods across Miami.

Miami-Dade County alone owns nearly 300 properties in Liberty City.<br><br>A number of these government-owned properties are underused or vacant.

							<p><b>1.</b> As part of the New Housing Marketplace Plan (2004-2014), the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development acquired and redeveloped several underused public properties, including various municipal parking lots, into mixed-use affordable housing developments. The housing agency also worked with the Department of Education to convert two former public schools in Harlem into affordable homes for 185 families.<br><br><b>2.</b> 
	In 2015, the Los Angeles School District completed its first affordable housing development on district-owned land adjacent to a public high school. Built in partnership with a nonprofit affordable housing developer and the City of Los Angeles, the 90-unit Sage Park Apartment complex gives priority to district employees. The School District is currently developing three other workforce housing projects on excess district-owned land.<br><br><b>3.</b> 
	In 2017, the City of Miami Beach evaluated the viability of retrofitting existing city-owned parking garages to include workforce housing. Below is the general criteria used by the city to determine the feasibility of converting existing floors of the parking garage as well as adding additional floors on top of the structure for workforce housing. The preliminary study found that three public parking structures in Miami Beach could potentially be used to accommodate workforce housing.</p>
